        <h1>The QR codes for your plants are below:</h1>
        <p>Please Save these QR images and then click submit to begin installing logging software.
        <br>
        <p>Installation will take 3-10 minutes and the Viper box will restart several times.<br> Please do not interrupt this process!
        <br>
        When installation is complete, you will see the green LED on the Viper breathing slowly.
        <br>
        When this happens you may safely unplug the box and redeploy to the location it will be used.
        <br>
        If the LED is not breathing slowly after 10 minutes or more, follow the instructions at *link* to reset and try again.
        <br>
        After two or more unsuccessful attempts, please contact customer support.
